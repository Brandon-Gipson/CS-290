                <h2>About this guide</h2>
                <p>This guide is meant to be a basic introduction to API provide by Riot Games for League of Legends.
				As such this guide will not cover everything nor will it cover the basic set up of your programming environment.
				<br>This guide will primarily show you how to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Retrieve your api key from Riot
					<li>Make calls to retrieve a player's (summoner's) information based on their name
					<li>Make calls to retrieve a summoner's match history based on the information retrieved from the last request
					<li>Give you an idea of what to do with all of this information
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>There is a lot of data we could retrieve from the Riot servers which can be manipulated in many different ways.
				Focusing on these basics will provide you with a good platform and general knowledge to create more complex
				websites using this API.</p>

                <h2>Set Up</h2>
                <p> Everything we will do in this guide requires a very special object that you can only get from Riot themselves.
					This is the magical API key. It is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Picture the Riot API being locked 
					behind a digital door. Well the API key is how we unlock that door. So where do we get this key? Well that's 
					easy. First go to this <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">link</a>. You should see a page that looks like this:</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qVNqOi5.jpg?1"/>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Next up click on the sign in link at the top right corner of the page. <br> It should bring up a link that looks like this:</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/duvG7LM.png?1"/>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>At this point if you already have a League of Legends account you can just log in with the same information. If not go]
				   ahead and click on the registrations page link. This will take you to a page where you can register a League of Legends
				   account. Once you sign up or sign in you should be given an API key:</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/0CAoxBx.jpg?1"/>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>I've taken out my own key from this image but it'll be right next to where it says "Key:".
					Now that you have your API key in hand you are ready to tackle some real coding applictions.</p>

                    <h3>A Short Interlude</h3>
                    <p> Match History is something everyone cares about in League of Legends and something that every good
						LoL website has. This part of the guide aims to show you how to build your own match history and what
						you can do with it. I've split this into two easy to follow parts. The first is this page which covers
						how to retrieve a player's summoner information. The second is the next page which will focus on how to
						use that information to retrieve a match history. </p>
					<br>
					<h3>Summoner Info</h3>
					<p> Primarily we access Riot's API through get requests sent to their servers. What
						this request looks like changes based on what information we are trying to get but usually takes on
						a specific form each time: </p>
					<code>https://{region}.api.pvp.net/api/lol/{region}/{request specific pathing}/{search term}?api_key={your api key} </code>
					<p> The first bracketed component is pretty straight forward. League of Legends is a multi-region game so
						you must specify which one you'd like. Next up is the {request specific pathing} which denotes what
						type of data we are looking form. This is the part that can look the most diverse depending on the 
						data we seek. For the purpose of retrieving a summoner's information we will be looking at this one:</p>
					<code>/api/lol/na/v1.4/summoner/by-name/{summonerNames}</code>
					<p> It's not too scary to look at and should be pretty straight forward. Basically it takes in a string of the summoner's
						name sends back a JSON object chalk full of information. So let's look at an example of how to retrieve one of
						these objects from riot.</p>
					<p> So to start I'm going to use my own summoner name "Eboncross" to demonstrate how we'd retrieve the summoner
						data. Now the way that I ended up getting user input was by use of a form which submits post data back to 
						the page with my inputed summoner name. I'm going to skip all of <br>that though as it's not really in the scope
						of this how-to. When my handler detects that a summoner's name has been entered it sends a request to the
						Riot servers that looks like this: </p>
					<code> request('https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v1.4/summoner/by-name/'+ req.body.name +'?api_key={my api key}', function(err, response, body){...} </code>
					<p> This pretty much mirrors what we talked about above and is pretty straight forward. "req.body.name" is information from my form aka 
						the summoner name and "{my api key}" is my literal API key without the brackets. When we send this off to Riot
						we get an object back that looks like this:</p>
					<code>
						{"eboncross": {<br>
						"id": 19089071,<br>
						"name": "Eboncross",<br>
						"profileIconId": 592,<br>
						"revisionDate": 1449036186000,<br>
						"summonerLevel": 30}} </code>
					<p> What are we looking at here? Well what we have is an object named "eboncross" which is the search term we used. 
						This object contains other references or foreign keys that we could then use in other queries such as my
						summoner id "19089071", the id for the profile icon I use, etc. Pretty easy to understand naming conventions
						have been used.	</p><p>Next up is to show how we take this object and turn into something we can actually use with other requests.</p>

    <!-- Match History Section -->
    <section id="matchHistory" class="container content-section text-center">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                <h2>Getting the Match History</h2>
               <p> In this section of the guide we are going to look at how to make a request for a particular summoner's match history
				   based on the summoner information we recieved from our last request. Specifically we will be using the summoer's id.
				   As a preview this is the request format we will be using this time: </p>
				<code>/api/lol/na/v2.2/matchlist/by-summoner/{summonerId}</code>
				<p> Again it is pretty straight forward and looks a lot like the prvious request. Now heading right back to where we left
					off last time let's look at what we need to do our previous request to make it usable in our new request: </p>
				<code> var summoner = JSON.parse(body); <br>
					   for (i in summoner){ <br>
					   var summonerID = summoner[i]["id"];} </code>
				<p> Let's take a closer look at what this is doing. First we have the line <code> var summoner = JSON.parse(body); </code>. Essentially this takes
					the information sent back to us from Riot and houses it in a variable called summoner. Next part of the the code cycles through that variable
					to create a new house called summonerID for my summoner's id. Now what I didn't mention before is that you can actually use the request to search
					for multiple summoners at a time. This is why the object returned from Riot uses our search term as a name. It is possible to get multiple 
					objects each representing a different summoner. This is also why we must us a loop to create the new variable. There is often a time you would
					need to search for more than one summoner at a time so the above code is designed to work for onle one. The next step in building our match
					history looks much like the prvious step: </p>
				<code> request('https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v2.2/matchlist/by-summoner/' + summonerID + '?api_key={my api key}', function(err, response, body){});</code>
				<p> Basically all we are doing is using the previously created summonerID variable in this request. What this will return is the following:</p>
				<code> {"matches": [ {<br>
						"timestamp": 1439450312819,<br>
						"champion": 222,<br>
						"region": "NA",<br>
						"queue": "RANKED_SOLO_5x5",<br>
						"season": "SEASON2015",<br>
						"matchId": 1917929861,<br>
						"role": "DUO_CARRY",<br>
						"platformId": "NA1",<br>
						"lane": "BOTTOM"}, ....</code>
				<p> This will repeat over and over for each individual match in your match history giving you access to a lot of information. Next up I'll show you what you can do with all this data.</p>

                <h2>Now What?</h2>
                <p> Basically what I have shown you today is how to make a request to Riot's API for data and then
				    how to use that data in future reqeusts. It doesn't seem like much but really it's the basic 
					foundation for everything the Riot API allows you to do. For example you can now take the 
					matchID information you pulled from the match history request and make another request to
					<code>/api/lol/na/v2.2/match/{matchId}</code> to get the specific match details. If you keep
					using these building blocks eventually you can make an awesome website like <a href="http://www.lolking.com">lolking.com</a>
					which is etirely based on what I just showed you.</p>
