	<h1>Getting Summoner Information</hi>
	<br>
	<h3>A Quick Note on Match History</h3>
	<p>
<li><code>/api/lol/na/v2.2/matchlist/by-summoner/{summonerId}</code>

Now if I wanted to use any information from this object in another request (and we do) I 
	would have to something like this:
	<br>
	<br>
	<pre><code>
	  var summoner = JSON.parse(body);
	  for (i in summoner){
		  var summonerID = summoner[i]["id"];
	  }
	</code></pre>
	<br>
	<br>
	Let's take a closer look at what this is doing. First we have the line <code> var summoner = JSON.parse(body); </code>. Essentially this takes
	the information sent back to us from Riot and houses it in a variable called summoner. Next part of the the code cycles through that variable
	to create a new house called summonerID for my summoner's id. Now what I didn't mention before is that you can actually use the request to search
	for multiple summoners at a time. This is why the object returned from Riot uses our search term as a name. It is possible to get multiple 
	objects each representing a different summoner. This is also why we must us a loop to create the new variable. There is often a time you would
	need to search for more than one summoner at a time so the above code is designed to work for onle one. The next step in building our match
	history looks much like the prvious step:
	<br>
	<br>
	<pre><code>
	request('https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v2.2/matchlist/by-summoner/' + summonerID + '?api_key={my api key}', function(err, response, body){
      var matchList = JSON.parse(body);});
	</code></pre>
	<br>
	<br>
	Basically all we are doing is using the previously created summonerID variable in this request. What this will return is the following:
	<br>
	<br>
	<pre><code>
	{
   "matches": [
      {
         "timestamp": 1439450312819,
         "champion": 222,
         "region": "NA",
         "queue": "RANKED_SOLO_5x5",
         "season": "SEASON2015",
         "matchId": 1917929861,
         "role": "DUO_CARRY",
         "platformId": "NA1",
         "lane": "BOTTOM"
      }, ....
	</code></pre>
	<br>
	<br>
	This will repeat over and over for each individual match in your match history. Now what you can do with this is vast. You can take one of the
	variable such as the matchID, assign it to a variable like we did above with the summoner id, and use that in a request to get that matches
	specific information. You can then take that info and create a gorgeous match history website. I'm not going to walk you through those steps
	as they are basically just repeating what I've already shown you here. I will, however, show you how to get basic champion information so
	click next to continue.
